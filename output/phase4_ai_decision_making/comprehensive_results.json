By merging these project-specific clusters, users will have a single, comprehensive view of all communications for that particular client or initiative. This approach prioritizes project-centric organization over a chronological or topic-specific split within a project, as it's more intuitive for users to find all information about 'EcoBloom' in one place, regardless of whether it's planning, design, or legal review."

This merge provides a more cohesive view of planning and execution for the EcoBloom project and related Q3 activities. I chose to keep the other clusters as is because they each focus on distinct projects (FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, UrbanEdge) with no significant overlap in topics or phases that would warrant merging or splitting. Each of these clusters is coherent, project-specific, and appropriately sized for user searchability. I did not find evidence in the provided sample messages of cluster_002 mixing FitFusion and TechNova as initially considered in the output format example; hence, no split was necessary for cluster_002 or any other cluster."

This merge provides a more cohesive view of planning and execution for the EcoBloom project and related Q3 activities. I chose to keep the other clusters as is because they each focus on distinct projects (FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, UrbanEdge) with no significant overlap in topics or phases that would warrant merging or splitting. Each of these clusters is coherent, project-specific, and appropriately sized for user searchability.

The only clear merge that improves discoverability without creating an oversized cluster is combining EcoBloom kickoff/scheduling with revision discussions (clusters 001 and 006). Other same-project clusters represent distinct phases or subtopics (e.g., FitFusion trademark/taglines vs. brand guidelines; TechNova budget vs. product descriptions; GreenScape extension coordination vs. data visualizations), so keeping them separate preserves clarity. No clusters mix multiple projects, and the only large cluster (TechNova budget) appears cohesive in topic, so no splits are recommended."

Clusters 001 through 005 are each highly coherent and focused on a single, distinct client project (EcoBloom, FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, and UrbanEdge, respectively). Merging them would violate the principle of keeping different projects separate. Cluster 006 is a distinct, higher-level planning conversation about the 'Q3 Content Calendar' which spans multiple projects. While it references projects from other clusters (EcoBloom and FitFusion), its core topic is cross-project coordination. Merging it into the project-specific clusters would dilute their focus, and splitting it would unnaturally break apart a single, coherent planning discussion. Therefore, maintaining all six clusters as they are provides the most logical and user-friendly organization."

Clusters 001 through 005 are each highly coherent and focused on a single, distinct client project (EcoBloom, FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, and UrbanEdge, respectively). Merging them would violate the principle of keeping different projects separate. Cluster 006 is a distinct, higher-level planning conversation about the 'Q3 Content Calendar' which spans multiple projects. While it references projects from other clusters (EcoBloom and FitFusion), its core topic is cross-project coordination. Merging it into the project-specific clusters would dilute their focus, and splitting it would unnaturally break apart a single, coherent planning discussion. Therefore, maintaining all six clusters as they are provides the most logical and user-friendly organization.\"\n}\n```",

No clusters were identified as needing a split, as none mixed multiple primary projects or wildly disparate topics within themselves."

Similarly, merging clusters for FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, and UrbanEdge would group all relevant discussions under their respective projects. Cluster_008 (Q3 Content Calendar) and cluster_011 (EcoBloom Summer Campaign Finalization) are kept as is because they are distinct and focused on specific tasks or phases that do not overlap with other clusters. No splits are recommended as the clusters are already well-segmented by project and phase."

Similarly, merging clusters for FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, and UrbanEdge would group all relevant discussions under their respective projects.
