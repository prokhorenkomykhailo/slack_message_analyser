MODEL_SCORE_91_1_VERIFICATION,Formula,Value,Explanation
Cluster Count Score,=MIN(6,7)/MAX(6,7)*100,85.7,Penalty for generating 7 clusters instead of 6 expected
Coverage Score,=6/6*100,100.0,Found all 6 expected benchmark clusters
Precision Score,=AVERAGE(100,78.33,100,100,100,100,100),96.9,Average precision across all 7 clusters
Deviation Score,=MAX(0,100-18.24),81.76,Penalty for message count deviations from benchmark
Final Model Score,=A2*0.25+A3*0.25+A4*0.25+A5*0.25,91.1,Weighted average of all four metrics

Step-by-Step Calculation,,,,,
Step 1: Cluster Count,=MIN(6,7)/MAX(6,7)*100,85.7,Expected: 6 clusters, Generated: 7 clusters
Step 2: Coverage,=6/6*100,100.0,Found all 6 expected clusters
Step 3: Precision,=AVERAGE(100,78.33,100,100,100,100,100),96.9,Average of all precision values
Step 4: Deviation,=MAX(0,100-18.24),81.76,Average absolute deviation: 18.24%
Step 5: Final Score,=85.7*0.25+100*0.25+96.9*0.25+81.76*0.25,91.1,Weighted sum of all components
