Clusters 001 through 005 are each highly coherent and focused on a single, distinct client project (EcoBloom, FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, and UrbanEdge, respectively). Merging them would violate the principle of keeping different projects separate. Cluster 006 is a distinct, higher-level planning conversation about the 'Q3 Content Calendar' which spans multiple projects. While it references projects from other clusters (EcoBloom and FitFusion), its core topic is cross-project coordination. Merging it into the project-specific clusters would dilute their focus, and splitting it would unnaturally break apart a single, coherent planning discussion. Therefore, maintaining all six clusters as they are provides the most logical and user-friendly organization."

Clusters 001 through 005 are each highly coherent and focused on a single, distinct client project (EcoBloom, FitFusion, TechNova, GreenScape, and UrbanEdge, respectively). Merging them would violate the principle of keeping different projects separate. Cluster 006 is a distinct, higher-level planning conversation about the 'Q3 Content Calendar' which spans multiple projects. While it references projects from other clusters (EcoBloom and FitFusion), its core topic is cross-project coordination. Merging it into the project-specific clusters would dilute their focus, and splitting it would unnaturally break apart a single, coherent planning discussion. Therefore, maintaining all six clusters as they are provides the most logical and user-friendly organization.\"\n}\n```",
