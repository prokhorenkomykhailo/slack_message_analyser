Hi [Client Name],

Great questions! Let me clarify both points for you:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 QUESTION 1: Status - What's the difference between "active" and "in_progress"?

There are actually TWO types of status in the Excel files:

1️⃣ TOPIC/PROJECT LEVEL (the overall conversation or project):
   • "active" = Urgent, needs immediate attention right now
   • "in_progress" = Work is happening, but less time-sensitive
   • "completed" = Fully finished

2️⃣ ACTION ITEM LEVEL (individual tasks):
   • "pending" = Not started yet
   • "in_progress" = Currently being worked on  
   • "completed" = Task finished

EXAMPLE from your data:
Topic: "EcoBloom Summer Campaign"
  → Status: "active" (urgent deadline approaching)
  → Action Item #1: "pending" (hasn't started)
  → Action Item #2: "in_progress" (Sam is working on it)
  → Action Item #3: "completed" (already done)

So "active" means the whole project is hot/urgent, while "in_progress" at the topic level means work is happening but it's less critical.

📅 QUESTION 2: What is the current date used for the testing?

The AI models were tested on: October 19, 2025

However, the test data (simulated Slack messages) covers a 3-month period:
  • Start: June 15, 2025
  • End: September 15, 2025

So all the dates you see in the Excel files (like due dates "2025-07-28") are from the SIMULATED conversations that happened between June-September 2025. The AI models were analyzing these "historical" messages to extract the dates, deadlines, and action items correctly.

Think of it like this:
✓ Test date = October 19, 2025 (when we ran the evaluation)
✓ Data dates = June-Sept 2025 (timeframe of the conversations being analyzed)

I've also created a detailed explanation document (CLIENT_STATUS_EXPLANATION.md) in the same folder as your Excel files if you need more details.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Best regards
