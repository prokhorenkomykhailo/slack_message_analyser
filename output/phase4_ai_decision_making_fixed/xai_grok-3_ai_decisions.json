Cluster_001 and cluster_006 were merged due to their shared focus on content planning, with cluster_006's Q3 content calendar likely encompassing EcoBloom's campaign. Clusters 002, 003, and 004 were split due to their large message counts (>25) and the likelihood of distinct sub-topics within each project (e.g., strategy vs. legal agreements). Cluster_005 was left as is since it has a manageable size and appears focused on a single topic. After merging 2 clusters into 1 and splitting 3 clusters into 6, the total number of clusters increases from 6 to 9, which is a step toward the target range. Further splits or merges may be needed based on additional data or refined analysis, but this provides a balanced starting point."

Cluster_001 and cluster_006 were merged due to their shared focus on content planning, with cluster_006's Q3 content calendar likely encompassing EcoBloom's campaign. Clusters 002, 003, and 004 were split due to their large message counts (>25) and the likelihood of distinct sub-topics within each project (e.g., strategy vs. legal agreements). Cluster_005 was left as is since it has a manageable size and appears focused on a single topic. After merging 2 clusters into 1 and splitting 3 clusters into 6, the total number of clusters increases from 6 to 9, which is a step toward the target range. Further splits or merges may be needed based on additional data or refined analysis, but this provides a balanced starting point.\"\n}",
