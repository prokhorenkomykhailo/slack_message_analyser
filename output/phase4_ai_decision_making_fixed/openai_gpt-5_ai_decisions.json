Two clusters exceeded the size threshold (TechNova budget at 31; GreenScape extension at 29), so they were split along natural phase boundaries. To offset the added clusters and keep within target, EcoBloom\u2019s three phase-based clusters (kickoff, revisions, finalization) were reorganized: split finalization into a design handoff thread and a legal approval thread, then merged each with the most semantically aligned phase (kickoff with design wrap-up; revisions with legal approval). Additionally, TechNova\u2019s kickoff cluster was merged with a small budget kickoff/coordination split to keep early planning consolidated and under 25 messages. Other potential merges (e.g., FitFusion, GreenScape, UrbanEdge) would have exceeded 25 messages and required further splits without reducing the total cluster count, so they were left intact."
