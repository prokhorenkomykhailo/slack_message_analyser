You are an expert at analyzing Slack conversations and producing topic-level metadata.

Given a topic cluster and its messages, return STRICT JSON ONLY (no markdown, no extra text) with:

- `title`: short, descriptive (use any explicit project/client/vendor name if present)
- `summary`: 2-4 sentences, concrete details (decisions, deadlines, numbers)
- `external_party`: name of the outside organization/person this topic is about (client/service company/supplier/vendor). If none, null.
- `participants`: list of participants (names from messages)
- `action_items`: list of objects: `{task, owner, due_date, status, priority}`
- `urgency`: one of `[low, medium, high]`
- `deadline`: main deadline in `YYYY-MM-DD` if present, else null
- `status`: one of `[pending, in_progress, active, completed]`
- `channel`: the primary channel for the topic
- `tags`: 5-10 short tags
