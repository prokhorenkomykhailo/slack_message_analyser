| `INPUT_TOKENS` | Tokens used for input | `25474` |
| `OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Tokens generated | `2080` |
| `TOKEN_COST` | Cost in dollars | `$2.53455` |

### **Benchmark Comparison**
| Column | What It Shows | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `BENCHMARK_CLUSTER_ID` | Reference cluster ID | `eco_bloom_campaign` |
| `BENCHMARK_TITLE` | Reference cluster title | `"EcoBloom Campaign"` |
| `BENCHMARK_MESSAGE_COUNT` | How many messages should be in this cluster | `44` |
| `LLM_MESSAGE_COUNT` | How many messages the model put in this cluster | `44` |

### **Matching Analysis**
| Column | What It Shows | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `MATCHED_MESSAGES` | Messages correctly placed | `44` |
| `MISSING_MESSAGES` | Messages that should be here but aren't | `0` |
| `EXTRA_MESSAGES` | Messages that shouldn't be here but are | `0` |

### **Quality Metrics**
| Column | What It Shows | Formula | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|---------|
| `MESSAGE_COUNT_DEVIATION_PERCENT` | How far off the message count is | `((LLM_COUNT - BENCHMARK_COUNT) / BENCHMARK_COUNT) × 100` | `0.0%` (perfect) |
| `COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE` | What % of expected messages were found | `(MATCHED_MESSAGES / BENCHMARK_COUNT) × 100` | `100.0%` (perfect) |
| `PRECISION_PERCENT` | What % of model's messages were correct | `(MATCHED_MESSAGES / LLM_COUNT) × 100` | `100.0%` (perfect) |
| `RECALL_PERCENT` | What % of expected messages were found | `(MATCHED_MESSAGES / BENCHMARK_COUNT) × 100` | `100.0%` (perfect) |

### **Final Scoring**
| Column | What It Shows | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `IMPROVED_MODEL_SCORE` | Overall model performance (0-100) | `91.1` (excellent) |
