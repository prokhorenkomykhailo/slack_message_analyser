Clusters were kept as is if they represented distinct projects for the same client (e.g., UrbanEdge Social Media vs. UrbanEdge Market Research) or if they were overarching internal projects that referenced client work but weren't specific to any single client (e.g., Q3 Content Calendar). No clusters were identified as needing a split, as none mixed multiple primary projects or wildly disparate topics within themselves."
