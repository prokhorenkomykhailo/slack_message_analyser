The messages are all related to planning and executing the EcoBloom campaign, with a clear overlap in participants and temporal proximity.\n\n2. **Cluster Splitting:**\n   - **Cluster Involved:** `cluster_002` (Technical Discussion)\n   - **Reason:** Messages 14 and 15 are distinct in topic, focusing on the FitFusion rebranding project, which is separate from the EcoBloom campaign. This necessitates a split to maintain topic coherence.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Semantic Overlap:** The messages in the merged cluster all pertain to the EcoBloom campaign, discussing timelines, deliverables, and project management, indicating a high degree of semantic similarity.\n- **Participant Overlap:** Many of the same participants are involved in the discussions across the merged clusters, further justifying the merge.\n- **Channel and Temporal Proximity:** All messages are within the same channel and time frame, supporting the decision to merge based on temporal proximity and channel consistency.\n- **Distinct Topics:** The FitFusion project messages are distinct in content and focus, warranting a separate cluster to maintain clarity and coherence.",
